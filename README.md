This code can be used to recreate the models from the paper "Non-linear, bivariate stochastic modelling of
power-grid frequency applied to islands". 
\
The power grids considered are the Irish grid, the Balearic grid and the grid of Iceland.
\
Synthetic time series are created in [Create_synthetic_time_series.ipynb](Create_synthetic_time_series.ipynb).
